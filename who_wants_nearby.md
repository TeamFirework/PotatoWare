# The Future of PotatoWare Nearby
PotatoWare's upcoming Nearby feature, projected for v1.0.0, is a feature that allows you to interact with people on the local network, and if you want,
across the Internet. Here are some things you can do:
## Messenger
You can exchange messages with people actively connected to the Internet from within PotatoWare!
It may, in the future, include games and activities.
## Battle
You can play a PotatoWare battle with someone nearby. You will need two Windows computers, both with their own installation of PotatoWare. Both computers need Wireless LAN access.
## User List
You can see the available users nearby.
## Development status
Currently, Nearby is not available, nor is it being developed. Get hyped for this major feature in the future!
